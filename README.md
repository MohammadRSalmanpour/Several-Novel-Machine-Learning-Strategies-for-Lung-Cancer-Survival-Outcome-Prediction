Title: Novel Machine Learning Strategies for Lung Cancer Survival Prediction: Study of Semi-supervised Learning and Radiomics

Radiamic Feature Names indicated feature names used in the paper. Semi_and_Supervised Classification tasks file is for all regression analyses. The code includes a total of 10 regressors were used, including AdaBoost Regressor (ABR), Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), Random Forest Regressor (RFR), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPR), K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNNR ), Decision Tree Regressor (DTR), Linear Regression (LR), Lasso Regression (LSR), Support Vector Machine (SVR), and Bagging Regression (BR), all is linked with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In semi-supervised strategy, “pseudo labels” is used to train the model in a supervised way on the unlabeled data. Meanwhile, in Pseudo-labeling, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPR) was employed to label the patients with missing values using training data, which were subsequently integrated into the training dataset for further analysis.

Survival Analysis Tasks file is for all survival prediction analyses. The code includes 3 known survival prediction algorithms such as Fast Survival Support Vector Machines (FSSVM), Component-wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis (CWGBSA), and Random Survival Forest (RSF) linked with PCA were employed to survival analysis.
